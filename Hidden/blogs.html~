      AI should not be regulated by the government. If AI is reqgulated by the government, I believe the goverment could use that against us. If the government has access to a more advanced version of our AI - which they probably already do have - who knows what they'll be able to utilize it for. While we always have a less advanced version of the technology the government has access to, we will not be able to advance as quickly in terms of technology and our overall society. While I think there are some important things the government should regulate, this is not one of them.
