      <h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi. My name is Qasem. I'm currently enrolled in Allen Highschool and am in
        my senior year. I have many interests and hobbies. One of my hobbies involves computers. I like to code,
        and some of my favorite languages are Java, Python, and C++, although I admittedly haven't used them in
        long time. Another thing I like to do with computers is graphic design. My favorite software to use overall
        is Adobe Photoshop. I also like to cook, bake, and sleep. This is basically all there is to me.
        Congratulations you know everything about me.</h4>
    <h1 class="title"> Importance of a Digital Portfolio</h1>
    <h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Digital portfolios are an important part in every person's financial and academic career. It is a way
        to show off some of my skills to potential employers, my friends, and it may even help out when I apply to college. Those are just
        some of the reasons why a portfolio is important to me. It is also a good way to show myself how much I've improved since I first
        started this portfolio, a way to demonstrate how far someone can come. </h4>
