	  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HTTPS is a more secure version of the HTTP we normally use. As a result of an increase in technological advancements, the price for encrypting a website with an HTTPS connection has become much lower. Most websites have begun using HTTPS connections because of their reasonable price point. Although this is great news for many individuals, the problem that this has created is that educational institutions, employers, and other – equally nosy – people are unable to see everything that is going on in everyone’s devices. To counter this. A device called an HTTPS Proxy Appliance was constructed. This device guarantees the person(s) using it to demolish any false sense of security one may think they have while browsing a website that uses an HTTPS connection. The way an HTTPS Proxy Appliance works is that any corporation, educational institution, or other Internet connectivity provider who wishes to view every single thing that a person does on the internet, all they have to do is to add a “Pseudo Certificate Authority”. This “extra certificate” decrypts all HTTPS traffic from the user’s web browser. Man-in-the-middle attack. A hash is a process in which a string of characters are changed into another, unrecognizable value. A good hash is something such as a cryptographic hashes. These are complex mathematical algorithms that cautiously process all the information given to them. They have this property which makes it so that if even one small part/section of the certificate is changed. As a result, half of the fingerprint’s hash is going to change. CA stands for the words “Certificate of Achievement”. SSL interception is unavoidable. Rather than preventing it, however, it’s easy to determine whether it is being intercepted or not. When examining an SSL Certificate, a fingerprint is created. Every SSL-intercepting Proxy Appliances will create a fake certificate. This certificate contains a private key, which is impossible to match to the remote server’s private key. This is because the remote server’s private key is kept, well, private. It’s a secret and cannot be known. This causes the fingerprint of the intercepting appliance’s fingerprint to be completely different than that of the website’s fingerprint.
	  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are cases where the user gets a false-positive mismatch. Companies like Amazon or Google have a significant and extensively dispersed web presence and may use a variety of security certificates on their numerous geographically dispersed servers and websites. While their security is unaffected, several certifications are simpler for them to handle. It does imply that not everyone user of their servers would technically get the same security certificate. This means that a quick comparison of certificate fingerprints could mislead users testing these large websites into thinking that their connections were being intercepted when in fact they had just received a different legitimate certificate than the one this website had received and displayed. The ideal method is to use an EV-honoring web browser such as Firefox or Chrome, to test smaller sites that are known to use single certificates or sites utilizing completely unspoofable EV certificates.
