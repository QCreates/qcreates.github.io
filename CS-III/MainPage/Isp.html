      <h1>Concept</h1>
      <h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my ISP (independent study project), I've created a game with two
	other people in a pixelated style. It is an RPG with a simple goal. For the player to get from one side of
	the island to the other. Once reaching the other side of the island, the player has successfully completed
	the game and can escape off the island on a tiny boat - eventually leading to the player sinking while on
	the boat.
      </h4>
      <h1>Motivation</h1>
      <h4>I've always wanted to make a game. This was the perfect oppurtunity to make the game I've always wanted
	to start on</h4>
      <h1>Code Segments</h1>
      <img class="codeSeg" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/drive-viewer/AJc5JmQ-DvXEZbazaow4v4CnkCyI3BeyQmdrPKcoeDA0z14Xrj-wns9w7soGtGzNM4PWkUh-y-wsgkI=w1920-h1062">
      <h4>This is just a small segment of the overall code with a simple function. As the name of the method
	suggests, it is meant to recieve damage and is told what to do once the damage is recieved. Firstly, it checks
	if the player is currently immune to taking damage. If so, then it will not run and the player will not
	recieve any form of damage. However, if the immunity runs out, then the method runs and the damage deducts
	the amount of health the player currently has. It also "pushes" the player a small distance depending on the
	amount of damage acted upon the player. Another thing this method does is it displays the amount of damage
	taken. Lastly, the code checks if the player's health is less than 0. If so, then the method, "Death", is run
	and that begins the process of the player dying.</h4>
      <h1>Conclusions</h1>
      <h4>Overall, this was a great learning experience. I underestimated the time and effort that it would take
	to create a game. The main issue that me and my group had was aligning our schedules together. The classes
	we were taking were completely different meaning we had different commitments at different times. We also
	wanted to do more than we could with the given time for the game. We were able to agree on a similiar game
	game concept so we started on the project rather quickly.</h4>
